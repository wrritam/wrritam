<em>I am a 2nd Year undergraduate student from <a href="https://www.heritageit.edu/"><b>Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata</b></a>. From very early on in my life, I started to fall in love with technology. This love has helped me develop a very good technological mindset <img src="https://github.com/rajput2107/rajput2107/blob/master/Assets/PC.gif" height="20px"/>, and given me the curiosity to learn more. I firmly believe that **no amount of knowledge <img src="https://github.com/rajput2107/rajput2107/blob/master/Assets/Rocket.gif" height="18px"> is enough knowledge**. ðŸ§ </em>
